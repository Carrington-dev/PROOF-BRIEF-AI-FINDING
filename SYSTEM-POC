I like the way Dovetail allows you to search across all your docs or per project.  A user can select/filter a specific project to do a search .We need to consider tagging and linking files together (+ the permission issue). It would be nice to also show the sources that the chat response has used with a link to each when providing a response. I personally think that saving chats is a minefield... Each chat could be a fresh query from the data.

Does the POC include uploading files? Do we "tag" them to the session, or are we thinking of creating a sharepoint folder if the user goes via this path?
