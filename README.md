Okta-Docs: Building and testing okta systems in Django and React/NextJS
## üîç Summary: What this middleware does

* Skips certain namespaces and view names.
* Authenticates requests using Okta-issued JWTs.
* Extracts the token, fetches the Okta JWKS, and verifies the token.
* Maps `sub` from token to a user, creating them if needed.

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Good

* Uses `requests` to fetch JWKS dynamically ‚Äî real-time verification.
* Verifies signature, `aud`, and `iss` claims.
* Skips auth for known public views (e.g., login, static files).
* Logs detailed events for debugging.
* Automatically creates users if they don‚Äôt exist.
* Elevates admin users based on an allowlist.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues & Weaknesses

### 1. **Performance: JWKS is fetched on every request**

Fetching the JWKS from Okta for every request is **inefficient** and can cause latency or failure if Okta is unavailable.

**Fix**: Cache the JWKS for a short period (e.g., 10 mins).

```python
from django.core.cache import cache

def get_jwks():
    cached_jwks = cache.get("okta_jwks")
    if cached_jwks:
        return cached_jwks
    try:
        response = requests.get(JWKS_URL)
        jwks = response.json()
        cache.set("okta_jwks", jwks, timeout=600)
        return jwks
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"JWKS fetch failed: {e}")
        return None
```

### 2. **No check on token `azp`, `scp`, or `email` claims**

The `sub` claim is being matched to `user_email`, but more secure would be checking additional claims like:

* `azp` (authorized party)
* `scp` (scope)
* `email` (direct from token if available)

**Fix**: Add verification like:

```python
if decoded_token.get("email", "").lower() != user_email.lower():
    return JsonResponse({"detail": "Email mismatch with token."}, status=403)
```

---

### 3. **Missing logging on critical auth outcomes**

You log success, but **not enough info** for failed auth (e.g., token invalid, user mismatch). These are helpful for auditing.

**Fix**: Log decoded claims or mismatches:

```python
logger.warning(f"Token sub: {decoded_token.get('sub')} does not match header email: {user_email}")
```

---

### 4. **Unsafe header reliance**

The middleware **trusts frontend-provided `BRIEF-AI-EMAIL` and `BRIEF-AI-USERNAME`**, which could be spoofed.

**Fix**: Trust only what‚Äôs in the token, and stop relying on external headers:

* Extract `email`, `name` from `decoded_token` instead.
* Remove the need for `BRIEF-AI-EMAIL` and `BRIEF-AI-USERNAME`.

---


---

### 5. **No fallback if JWKS fails**

If Okta is down and `requests.get()` fails, every request breaks.

**Fix**: Add a cached fallback or fail-soft strategy (e.g., retry or limited-time bypass for internal traffic).

---

### 6. **Class Based Implemetation But Not Object Oriented Implementaion**
This middle uses a class defination and even inherits a Mixin but it does not follow an OOPs standard, It's hard for a new person in the team to understand or enhance it because it's monolitic.

## ‚úÖ Suggested Improvements

| Area               | Suggested Action                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JWKS**           | Cache the JWKS                                                          |
| **Token Claims**   | Validate `email`, `scp`, `azp` explicitly                               |
| **Headers**        | Remove reliance on custom headers like `BRIEF-AI-EMAIL`                 |
| **Logging**        | Add warnings for mismatches, and log decoded claims for failed requests |
| **User Handling**  | Make `username` parsing robust                                          |
| **Testing**        | Add unit tests to simulate expired, malformed, and mismatched tokens    |

---

## ‚úÖ Optional Enhancements

* Add Django settings for toggling the middleware on/off in dev.
* Track how many times JWKS fails or add Sentry monitoring.
* Rotate RSA keys with caching refresh (in case Okta rotates).
